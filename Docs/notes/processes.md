# Processes

### Quorum

We seem to be missing proper SOP for Quorum for things such as voting for the CROP (for Kigali) so we need to establish something.



### RECORDINGS

We need to have a recording policy for items that are not supposed to be public.



### Confidentiality levels

We should establish these too.



### Elections



### Meetings



### Readouts
